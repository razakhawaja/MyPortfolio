I'm currently a UX Designer at <a href="https://www.smithweb.com" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> <span class="font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#000">Smith & Associates</span></a>, based in Houston, Texas. Previously, I have been a full stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.educative.io" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> <span class="cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:opacity-75 gradient-purple text-gradient">Educative</span></a>, and a Design Engineer at <a href="https://www.onesignal.com" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">
<span class="cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#e54b4d">OneSignal</span></a>. I have also worked with several research groups from various universities as a UX Consultant through the <a href="https://www.dvclab.net/" target="_blank">DVC Lab</a> at Purdue University.

Outside of work, you will often find me either immersed in a single-player video game, discussing sports a little too passionately, or trying to paint (I use soft pastels!). If you're interested in talking more about my work, research interests, or simply want to rant about how bad Manchester United are right now, send me an email over at raza.khawaja@hotmail.com.

If you've made it this far and aren't bored yet, here's some more info about me!

<span class="font-medium">Why did I switch from software engineering to design?</span>

I found that design allowed me to fully channel my creativity and explore my interest in human behaviour. Designing experiences brought me more joy and fulfillment than engineering them. Plus, with experience and education in both fields, I also enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering.

<span class="font-medium">What are my thoughts on AI and design?</span>

AI can definitely be used to design better experiences and allow the designer to focus more on understanding user needs and empathazing with them - things that AI can not do. However, AI is innovating fast so don't quote me in a few years time if a humanoid robot shows up asking for your clothes, boots and motorcycle.

<span class="font-medium">What specifically interests me about design?</span>

I enjoy working in ambigious spaces where I can speak to people and figure out how their problems can be solved. Specifically, I am most interested in cross-channel interaction design, AI's role in modern UX design, and studying <a href="https://www.deceptive.design/" target="_blank">dark patterns</a>.
