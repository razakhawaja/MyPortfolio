I recently completed my Master's degree at <span class="font-semibold hover:opacity-75" style="color:#8E6F3E">Purdue University</span> in UX Design. I currently work as a UX Consultant and Research Assistant at Purdue's <a href="https://www.dvclab.net/" target="_blank">DVC Lab</a> for the <a href="https://sciencegateways.org/" target="_blank">Science Gateways Community Institute</a>. Previously, I was a Design Engineering intern at

My interests revolve around UX Design & Research, Design Systems and Product Management.

As an engineer, I not only loved working as a technical design lead but also enjoyed engaging in the product and design discussions and enjoyed channeling my creativity there. This is why I am driven to complement my computer science background with a UX specialization. This has allowed me to find my place as a designer at the intersection of design and development.

Outside of work, you will often find me either immersed in a single-player video game, discussing sports a little too passionately, or trying to paint (I use soft pastels!). If you're interested in talking more about my work, research interests, or simply want to rant about how bad Manchester United are right now, send me an email over at raza.khawaja@hotmail.com.

If you've made it this far and aren't bored yet, here's some more info about me!

<span class="font-medium">Why did I switch from software engineering to design?</span>

I found that design allowed me to fully channel my creativity and explore my interest in human behaviour. Designing experiences brought me more joy and fulfillment than engineering them. Plus, with experience and education in both fields, I also enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering.

<span class="font-medium">What are my thoughts on AI and design?</span>

AI can definitely be used to design better experiences and allow the designer to focus more on understanding user needs and empathazing with them - things that AI can not do. However, AI is innovating fast so don't quote me in a few years time if a humanoid robot shows up asking for your clothes, boots and motorcycle.

<span class="font-medium">What specifically interests me about design?</span>

I enjoy working in ambigious spaces where I can speak to people and figure out how their problems can be solved. Specifically, I am most interested in cross-channel interaction design, AI's role in modern UX design, and studying <a href="https://www.deceptive.design/" target="_blank">dark patterns</a>.
